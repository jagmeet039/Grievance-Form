Problem Statement for creating a Grievance submittin platform:
--------------------------------------------------------------
1. Divide your UI screen in 2 parts
    a. Part A 
    b. Part B
2. Part A should display a form which collect the following details related to a grievance.
    Form should contain the following details:
    a. Email
    b. Title
    c. Description
3. On submit, the grievance details should be displayed in the Part B and the form in Part A should be reset
4. In Part B, when the grievance details are displayed, display 2 buttons
    a. One button named 'Resolved' (displayed in green color). On clicking this button update the status grievance to resolved.
    b. Other button named 'Rejected' (displayed in red color). On clicking this button update the status grievance to rejected.
5. If the status of the grievance is null, display the above 2 buttons.
    - else if the status is resolved, display a text 'Resolved' (in green color) instead of the above 2 buttons
    - else if the status is rejected, display a text 'Rejected' (in red color) instead of the above 2 buttons

React Hints:
------------
1. Maintain a state in the App.js with an array of grievance details. In the component render 2 components
    a. Component A which renders the form
        - On form submission collect the grievance details in an object and push them to the parent's state array
            where we are maintaining the grievance details array.
        - Using the concept of Parent-Child communication to acheive the above functionality.
        - Before pushing details in to the array add a status field (= null) for each object.
        - To reset the form on submission, use controlled inputs by using `value` attribute with input and textarea fields. 
    b. Component B which renders the greviance details
        - In the App.js, loop over the array of greviance details and render Component B
            for each of the object.
        - Pass a method as a prop to this component which updates the status of an greviance based on index.
            trigger the above method, on button clicks in the child component (Resolved and Rejected buttons)
        - Using the Parent-Child communication concept once again to achieve the above functionality.
